# Epic: AI Spec Drafting
id: EP-009
title: "AI-Powered Spec Drafting"
status: planned
priority: p1
owner: null
milestone: v1.1-usability
spec: null

description: |
  Use AI to help draft product specs from minimal input. Users describe
  what they want in natural language, and the AI generates a structured
  spec document following the project's conventions. This dramatically
  speeds up spec writing while maintaining consistency.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] prodman draft 'user auth with OAuth' generates spec draft"
  - "[ ] AI follows existing spec template structure"
  - "[ ] Generated specs include proper frontmatter"
  - "[ ] AI considers existing epics/specs for context"
  - "[ ] Interactive refinement (ask follow-up questions)"
  - "[ ] prodman draft --epic EP-001 scopes to specific epic"
  - "[ ] Draft appears in editor for review before saving"
  - "[ ] Web UI: 'Draft with AI' button in specs view"
  - "[ ] Support for different spec types (technical, user story)"
  - "[ ] AI suggests related epics and dependencies"
  - "[ ] Works with all configured AI providers"
  - "[ ] Streaming output for long generations"
