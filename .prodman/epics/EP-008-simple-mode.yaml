milestone: v1.1-usability
spec: null

description: |
  Provide a simplified interface for product managers and stakeholders
  who aren't comfortable with Git or command-line tools. The Web UI
  becomes the primary interface, with Git operations hidden behind
  simple "Save" and "Sync" buttons.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] prodman ui --simple starts simplified Web UI"
  - "[ ] Hide Git jargon (commits → saves, push → sync)"
  - "[ ] One-click sync button (handles add, commit, push)"
  - "[ ] Conflict resolution wizard (visual, no git commands)"
  - "[ ] Onboarding flow for first-time users"
  - "[ ] Inline help tooltips throughout UI"
  - "[ ] No terminal/CLI knowledge required"
  - "[ ] Auto-save with background commits"
  - "[ ] Undo/redo using Git history (hidden from user)"
  - "[ ] Desktop app wrapper (Electron/Tauri) - optional"
  - "[ ] Settings panel replaces config command"
