description: |
  Implement Git operations using isomorphic-git for the 
  commit-per-change model. Every save in the UI creates a commit. 
  Users sync (push) when ready to share with team.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[x] prodman sync pushes local commits to remote (via git CLI)"
  - "[x] prodman pull fetches and merges remote changes (via git CLI)"
  - "[x] prodman status shows pending (unpushed) commits"
  - "[x] Every save in Web UI creates a Git commit"
  - "[x] Auto-generated commit messages describe the change"
  - "[x] src/core/git.ts module with Git operations"
  - "[x] prodman diff shows uncommitted changes (colorized)"
  - "[x] Conflict detection on pull (pullWithConflictDetection)"
  - "[x] prodman resolve command for CLI conflict resolution"
  - "[x] prodman conflicts lists files with merge conflicts"
  - "[x] isomorphic-git integration (async functions added)"
  - "[x] Never corrupts Git repository (dogfooded in this repo)"
  - "[x] Works with repos that have other content (tested)"
